Portal Knight is a casual puzzle game focused on enhancing the player’s ability to maneuver the knight, one of the most challenging chess pieces. Players control a knight piece on a chessboard and must escape from enemy pieces using the knight's unique L-shaped movement pattern. Each level is procedurally generated, and enemies are dynamically placed along the player’s path, offering a fresh challenge every time.
