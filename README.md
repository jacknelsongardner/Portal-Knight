Portal Knight is a casual puzzle game with the goal of improving a users ability to maneuver the knight, one of the most challenging pieces in chess to take advantage of. Players control a knight piece on a chessboard and must escape from enemy pieces using the knight's unique movement pattern. The board is randomly generated for each level, and enemies are dynamically placed around the player's path, providing a fresh challenge each time.

    Enemy Placement: Enemies are intelligently spawned around the player's path, ensuring each level is uniquely challenging.
    Hints System: Players can activate hints to visualize potential escape routes or safe zones.
    Chess-Inspired Gameplay: Utilize the knight's movement (L-shaped pattern) to avoid enemies and reach the goal.
