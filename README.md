# PortalKnightUnityProjectFiles
In this 2d puzzle game, the playerâ€™s goal is to move a knight around on a chessboard to collect a key and enter a portal, whilst avoiding rooks, bishops, and queens. Player movement, enemy AI, and level selection are all completed. I'm currently forming a team of fellow WSU students to complete an app based on this prototype that allows the user to randomize level design, create their own levels, and share their achievements with other players. If are a student there or live in the Puget Sound area and would be interested in joining, feel free to contact me at this number:
